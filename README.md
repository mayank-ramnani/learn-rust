Learning Rust throught the Rust book
1. Hello World
- Get familiarized with the compiler and formatter
- `rustc main.rs` to compile
- `rustfmt main.rs` to format according to the rust language standards

2. Hello Cargo
- Get familiarized with cargo, which is the Rust package manager + build system
- `cargo new` to generate template of a new cargo project
- `cargo build` to build once you've created the Cargo.toml file
- `cargo run` to build and run the program
- `cargo check` to see if your code compiles; much faster than building it completely

3. Guessing Game
- Get familiarized with basic Rust concepts:
    + Using external packages by adding them to the Cargo.toml file
    + Loops using the `loop` keyword
    + Match various values using `match` keyword (similar to switch case)
    + and more...
